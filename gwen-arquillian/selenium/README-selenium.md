# Running Selenium

## Idea

Using this standalone Selenium Remote Driver it is a lot easier to update it to the latest version. It will also enable you to configure your local environment (instead of keeping this information within your project).

## Running

In order to run Selenium, download the latest Selenium driver from 

[http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/)

and place it in this folder.

You can then start a standalone remote Selenium driver using the `selenium.bat` batch file 
you find in this folder.

The current setup will pick up your locally installed browsers (i.e. Firefox) automatically without further configuration.

## TODO

  * Testing with Internet Explorer is still untested.
