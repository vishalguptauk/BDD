= Example for JGiven with Arquillian Graphene

== About

This show an example on how to integrate http://jgiven.org[JGiven^]
with http://arquillian.org/modules/graphene-extension/[Arquillian Graphene^]

This example will start a local browser and will run some tests on a web site.

== Features

The following features are shown in this example (see `StartPageFeature.java`):

  . Run Selenium via PhantomJS headless or interactively from IDE
  . Using both Given/When/Then concept together with the PageObject pattern used in selenium
  . Annotating the executed tests with screen shots

== How to run from command line and continuous integration

Install maven and run as follows:

   mvn clean verify

This will download http://phantomjs.org/[Phantom^] to run headless browser tests and run the tests using the `arquillian-headless.xml` settings.

To look at the results, open `target/jgiven-reports/html/index.html` to see <<report,the report>>.

== How to run from your IDE

According to `arquillian.xml` interactive tests will use a locally running Selenium server that will forward requests to a locally installed instance of Firefox.

Preparation:

  . ensure that Firefox is installed on the local machine
  . follow the instructions in `selenium/README-selenium.md` to download the most recent
    selenium JAR file
  . start `selenium/selenium.bat`

Running a Unit test from your IDE:

  . run `StartPageFeature.java` like you would run any other unit test.
