= Running Chromedriver

== Idea

Using this standalone Chromedriver it is a lot easier to update it to a version matching your Chrome installation.
It will also enable you to configure your local environment (instead of keeping this information within your project).

== Running

In order to run, download the latest ChromeDriver from 

https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads[https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads]

and place it in this folder.

You can then start a standalone remote Chrome driver using the `cdriver.bat` batch file you find in this folder.
